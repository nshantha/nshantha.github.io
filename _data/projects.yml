- project: Global Remote Electronics Unit for Bombardier Global
  role: Reviewer & Integration Tester
  duration: Nov, 2018 &mdash; May, 2019
  # url: "#"
  description: Verified control and monitoring of all primary and secondary flight controls, through an integrated Fly-By-Wire control system where PFCC’s receive pilot commands from the IIM’s and the AFCU which performs sensor selection and voting to calculate appropriate surface commands based on the PFCC State control laws.
              •	Analyzed requirements as per Software Detail Design (SWDD), and prepared test plans from High-Level Requirement (HLR) for Remote Electronics Unit in Bombardier Aircrafts
              •	Conducted Software-Software Integration Testing to prepare test scripts in Vector Cast tool from test plans, and executed it in code composer and Visual DSP simulator environment
              •	Conducted technical reviews of test plans, scripts, results, and HLR reviews with respect to system requirement; designed reviews to reduce error rate by ~70% and improve the quality of the plans

  role: Reviewer & Integration Tester
  duration: May, 2018 &mdash; Aug, 2018
  # url: "#"
  description: Controlled aspects of aircraft engine performance (air density, throttle lever position, engine temperatures, and engine pressures) and parameters like power output and fuel flow
              •	Analyzed requirements as per Software Detail Design (SWDD); prepared test plans from High-Level Requirement (HLR) for engine temperature and pressure
              •	Conducted Hardware-Software Integration Testing to prepare test script in CUTE tool and produce Ada-Test Harness file
              •	Executed Ada-Test Harness file in Ada-Test Harness Environment and RAPITA (target environment) to provide real-time verification solutions

- project: Doors and Slides Management System (DSMS) for Airbus A380
  role: Reviewer & Integration Tester
  duration: Jan, 2018 &mdash; April, 2018
  # url: "#"
  description: Verifying control unit of the DSMS installed in the avionics bay of various types of aircraft with different sets of doors to be monitored.  Verifying handling of DSMCU by software pin programming interface via the AFDX Bus.
              •	Analyzing requirements as per Software Design (SWDD), and performing black box testing in RTRT for low level requirements for the interface between AFDX bus and DSMCU.
              •	Conducting Expert and Audit reviews of developers test scripts to identify quality issues and to reduce customer feedback on deliverable artifacts and for certification purposes
              •	Mentoring 3 engineers for queries and test related and process related issues in the project.
